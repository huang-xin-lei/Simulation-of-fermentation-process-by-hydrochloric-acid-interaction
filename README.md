盐酸交互作用模拟发酵过程  
将多种发酵过程中的微生物的生长特性建立ode模型模拟发酵过程中盐浓度与有机酸积累对群落演替的影响，挖掘盐酸的交互作用对辣椒酱的发酵的控制规律。  
Based on the growth characteristics of microorganisms in various fermentation processes, an ODE model was established to simulate the effects of salt concentration and organic acid accumulation on community succession in the fermentation process, and explore the control law of the interaction of hydrochloric acid on the fermentation of chili sauce.
